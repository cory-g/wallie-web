My full name is _Sir Walter Mickey Moon_, but my friends call me simply '_Wallie_'. I am a male [standard poodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle). I live with my lovely family.

I am very playful with my large size I drop everything that crosses in my way.

I love eating and sleeping during the day, lie in the sun belly up is my preferred position.

Run and walk with my master are my favorite sports.
